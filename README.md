## General Info
In this project, I clone the zillow.com website using React js. The website has a number features such as the service the render such as buying, selling and renting a property.
The website also takes inputs such as location, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, price range and home types to help filter down the search.
This currently suited for mobile view and tablet view only. I adopted the mobile first approach so I can focus on the reponsiveness of the website with smaller devices first.
