## General Info
In this project, I clone the zillow.com website using React js. The website has a number features such as the service the render such as buying, selling and renting a property.
The website also takes inputs such as location, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, price range and home types to help filter down the search.
I adopted the mobile first approach so I can focus on the reponsiveness of the website with smaller devices.

* HTML
* CSS 
* React.js
